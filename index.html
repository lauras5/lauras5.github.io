    <h1>PRE-INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE</h1>

    <h3>Candidate name: Laura Salcido</h3>
    <h3>Position: Full Stack Web Engineer</h3>

<p>Below are a number of questions to help us better understand who you are and to get an idea of your experience with web development. Don't worry if you can't or prefer not to answer them all. Answer as many as you can to the best of your ability and please be as honest as possible. There are no right or wrong answers here. </p>

    <span><strong>1. Where do you currently live?</strong><span>
        <p>Santa Ana, CA</p>

    <span><strong>2. Are you able and willing to commute to Anaheim for work as required?</strong><span>
        <p>Yes!</p>

3. Do you have a reliable means of transportation?
Yes, my trusty Mazda 3.

4. Are you able and willing to commute to other locations in Southern California as required (i.e.- to work with clients)?
Yes

5. Are you able and willing to telecommute one or more days per week for work?
Yes

6. Do you have a reliable laptop computer that you can and are willing to use for work?
Yes, I have 2 in case one decides to act up.

7. What are your preferred hours for work?
I prefer early mornings, 8am-4pm.

8. How soon can you start?
July 23rd, 2018 (2 weeks).

9. Are you currently employed?
Yes.

10. If so, what are you doing in your present role?
Iâ€™m currently doing Inside sales and I am also a Teaching Assistant at UCI for web development, but Iâ€™m looking to transition into a full-time developer role.

11. How does your current (or most recent) job translate into skills that will help you succeed in this role?
My current role required me to communicate a lot with clients and have an eye for detail/design. I think this will be useful for me when communicating with our clients and helping them with their vision. The TA position gives me patience to deal with bugs and look at code carefully and with a lot of clarity.

12. Are you currently attending college classes or otherwise continuing your education?
Not at the moment.

13. If so, what are you currently studying?
Iâ€™m not studying at a school, but I do study through Pluralsight to improve on my technical skills.

14. In a few sentences at most, please explain how your current or most recent educational experience translates into skills that will help you succeed in this role.
I learned a lot about working with groups and how there is give and take with every project. I also learned to network which I think will also help in the future.

15. Which days and hours are you available to work?
Preferably Monday-Friday, 8am-6pm.

16. Can you work mornings, afternoons, evenings, and / or weekends if necessary?
Yes, if necessary.

17. Are there any days and times that you will not be available to work?
Tues & Thurs 5:30-10pm and Saturday 9-2:30 (TA at UCI), although I can make arrangements if I know Iâ€™ll miss a class ahead of time.

18. Do you have any ongoing or upcoming commitments that might interfere with your ability to work?
None.

19. Do you attend meetups or conferences for web developers or that are related to other areas of technology? If so, please briefly summarize your recent and or ongoing involvement in them.
I am involved with Women in Tech and I am part of a Tech Panel through UCI. I plan on joining more meetup groups in the following months.

20. What excites you most about the future of technology?
Everything! I love that itâ€™s becoming more integrated with our everyday lives, how it makes things that once seem impossible seem possible and how much easier it makes simple tasks. I always remember when my math teacher would say, â€˜you have to learn your multiplication tables, you wonâ€™t have a calculator in your pocket all the timeâ€™, and we totally do.

21. How much experience do you have with web development? In a few sentences, please briefly summarize your experience with web development.
Iâ€™ve always been interested in web development, but I think it all started with MySpace. I spent hours editing my page and seeing how far I could take it. I would always change it up and I was obsessed with doing more than everyone else. Not because I wanted it to look pretty, but because I was curious and wanted to see how many things I could do with it. I took a few classes in college, and always searched for jobs that required me to know some sort of computer program. It wasnâ€™t until I had a steady job that I realized what I really wanted to do was be a web developer, so I went back to school and here we are now ðŸ˜Š

22. In a few sentences at most, please summarize HTML as if you were explaining it to someone who knows absolutely nothing about web development.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It uses elements and attributes to help a developer set up the structure of a web page. It doesnâ€™t style a webpage, but you can use it in conjuncture with CSS.

23. Please do the same for JavaScript:
JavaScript is a language that allows you to build your website and make it functional. It creates events for your button clicks and makes your website responsive. If your website was a human, HTML would be the bones, JavaScript would be the muscles and CSS would be the skin.

24. What is your favorite new feature in JavaScript? What do you like about it? Is there anything you would like to change about that particular feature?
Iâ€™m using ES6, and my favorite thing about it are the fat arrow functions. I also like the â€˜letâ€™ and â€˜constâ€™ variable declarations because it makes it easier to organize the code. I wouldnâ€™t change anything about them.

25. What feature or features would you like to see most in the next iteration of ECMASCRIPT? Why?
I think I would like it to be a little stricter and for it to have more detailed error messages. I like how C# is so specific about errors. I spend a lot of my time debugging code.

26. What are your top three favorite frameworks (or programming languages)? Why are they your favorites? What do you like most about them? Is there anything you don't like about them?
I like JavaScript, Express and MongoDB. I like how well they work together, and it makes deploying simple. There is a lot of documentation, and once you get familiar with NPMs you can build anything.

27. What are your least favorite frameworks (or programming languages)? Why don't you like them? What don't you like about them?
I donâ€™t really dislike any. When I start learning them, I hate them because they are confusing, but once I pick it up I like them.

28. Do you prefer to use spaces or tabs when you code? Why?
I prefer Tabs, because itâ€™s faster and easier and I feel like it looks nicer. #teamTabs

29. How many websites have you built in the past year? In the past six months? In the past month?
Iâ€™ve build a lot of projects for class, but Iâ€™ve had 3 deployed websites. I also manage my blog on WordPress.

30. Where do you see yourself in five years?
Working for an amazing company and knowing a lot more about web development than I do now. I really want to make a name for myself in the tech world. Iâ€™d also love to start my own company teaching kids to code.

31. What is your favorite color? Why?
My favorite color bounces back and forth between blush pink and slate blue. They have always been my favorite colors, because they remind me of the summer sky.

32. What is your favorite CMS? Why? Why is it better than the other ones you may have tried?
Iâ€™m really only familiar with WordPress, but I like it. Itâ€™s easy to navigate and maintain. 

33. How many hours a week do you spend coding (on average)?
About 30-35 hours a week.

34. Do you code in your free time?
Yes. Iâ€™m always practicing and cleaning up old code.

35. What drew you to web development as a career?
The freedom. I like the fact that you can work remotely and still be able to get the same amount of work done that you would in the office.

36. What do you hope to get out of this job?
I hope to keep learning and I want to grow as a developer. I also want to make a difference, and hope that I can help lead the team closer to their goal.

37. In a few sentences, please summarize Cascading Style Sheets as if you were explaining it to someone who knows absolutely nothing about web development.
CSS makes the webpage look pretty. It lets you add backgrounds to pages, makes objects move on the page and choose what fonts you want to add. 

38. What are your favorite three features of CSS?
I like transform, because it makes your site more interesting. I like the opacity feature because it makes the pages look cleaner and if you have a lot of things on the page, itâ€™s nice to be able to focus on one specific item by making the rest of them opaque. I also like the fact that even if youâ€™re working with a library like Bootstrap or Materialize, you can still change the style by using an â€˜idâ€™ and overriding other designs so you can achieve the exact look you want.

39. Do you play video games? If so, what were the last three video games you played? What is your favorite video game of all time?
I like video games, but I donâ€™t play them often. I love puzzles like KenKen or sudoku. I like escape rooms and I also recently played a VR Alien game that I really liked.

40. Do you read books? If so, what were the last three books you read? What is your favorite book?
Yes, I read books, mostly about software development. I recently reread the Lord of The Rings trilogy and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Iâ€™m currently reading a book on Angular and Mongo as well as the book Origins by Dan Brown. 

41. Do you like sports? If so, what is your favorite sport? Why is it your favorite?
I like all sports, but I get really excited about football. Iâ€™m a Rams fan so Iâ€™m glad they came back to LA. Also, I feel like the seasons are short, so you can get really fired up because every game matters.

42. Do you exercise regularly? If so, what do you do? How often?
No, but I have a gym pass. I currently go about once a week and just do cardio and some weight lifting. Now that I donâ€™t have class in the afternoon though I plan on going more.

43. Do you have any other hobbies or interests that are important to you or that round out your professional profile?
I have a background in art.

44. If you could get paid the same amount to do any type of work for the day, what would you do?
Web Designing, painting or solving mysteries.

45. Why do you want this job? What do you hope to get out of it?
I hope to get experience and learn more about web development. I also want to be part of something important.

46. Why are you a good fit for this job? Why should we hire you?
Iâ€™m a hard working individual and I am very dependable. Iâ€™m the person that everyone wants to team up with and Iâ€™m a quick learner. I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll be disappointed if you hire me (or at least I hope not).

47. What is your favorite IDE or text editor? What do you love about it? Is there anything you would like to change about it?
Iâ€™ve used Sublime and VS Code. I have to say I like VS more, although Iâ€™ve heard great things about Atom. I donâ€™t think I would change anything, since Iâ€™ve customized mine to be exactly how I like it.

48. What is your favorite web browser? What do you like most about it? Is there anything you would like to change about it?
I like Chrome. The DevTools are my favorite part, I also like all the customizations and extensions that you can add to it. 

49. How familiar are you with the principles of web security? Please summarize your experience, if any.
Iâ€™m not too familiar with them. Iâ€™ve worked with authentication and authorization, but nothing outside of that. It was for a group project, we used web tokens to authenticate users and allow them to create a profile which only they had access to.

50. What would you say is the biggest security challenge facing web developers in the next six months?
I havenâ€™t looked into that too much, but I guess I would have to say defending against new technologies. Older websites are more at risk to be hacked, and with how fast technology moves, they would really need to update their websites regularly to avoid being hacked.

51. How familiar are you with the principles of User Experience Design?
I believe itâ€™s to make the user interaction with a website as intuitive and easy as possible.

52. In a few sentences, please summarize User Experience Design and its main advantages. Pretend that I'm a client who knows absolutely nothing about web or software development.
I donâ€™t think I know enough about it to explain it to someone, so I would probably go to google for it. Iâ€™ll have something ready by Tuesday.

53. Do you have any experience with Agile Software Development? If so, what was it?
No, not yet.

54. What is your favorite version control system? What do you like most about it? Is there anything you would like to change about it?
I like Git. Itâ€™s simple to use, fast, efficient and I can use it in the command line. I also like that GitHub is so easy to use.

55. Do you have any experience designing and administering databases? If so, which ones have you used and how much?
Yes, Iâ€™ve used MySQL and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve used MySQL more than MongoDB.

In a few sentences, please summarize the most important differences and advantages of relational vs. non-relational databases for web development.
Relational databases store info in tables and rows, non-relational stores data in json objects. One isnâ€™t better than the other, it just depends on what you plan to do. Relational databases like MySQL are good for apps where a lot of different data will interact with each other. I personally like MongoDB because items are stored in JSON/BSON format and you can use key/value pairs to filter through data. 

Do you like to explain things?
Yes, it helps me understand it better myself.

Do you like to sell things?
I have a long history as a salesman, but I would prefer to work behind the scenes.

Do you like to design things?
Yes, I have an eye for details.

What are your three strongest personality traits?
Determined, helpful and detail-oriented.

What are your biggest weaknesses or areas you feel you need the most work on?
I can sometimes take on more than I can comfortably handle. I can improve this by setting realistic expectations for myself.

What are your three strongest technology skills?
Iâ€™m great at google search, Wireframing and sketching out ideas, and Iâ€™m naturally curious so I look for answers before I have the problem. I also have a photographic memory which comes in handy.

What are the technology skills you are most interested in learning and improving?
Computer Development Skills, Database Skills and website testing.

In a few sentences, please summarize your educational background including any certifications or training that you feel would make you a valuable part of the team.
My background is in Art and Interior Architecture/Design. I always wanted to be a web developer, so I went back to school and took a coding boot camp at UCI. I excelled and now Iâ€™m super excited to start an exciting career in the tech industry as a full stack developer. Thanks to my background, I have a great eye for design and believe in function before fashion. Iâ€™m a natural problem solver, so Iâ€™m drawn to the backend. I think Iâ€™m pretty well rounded and I look forward to learning more and becoming an even better developer.
